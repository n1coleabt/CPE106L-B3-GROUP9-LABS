Programming Problem 2
Write a program that allows the user to navigate through the lines of text in a file. The program prompts the user for a filename and inputs the lines of text into a list. The program then enters a loop in which it 
prints the number of lines in the file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual line numbers range from 1 to the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the program prints the 
line associated with that number. 

Code: 
def read_file(filename):
    """
    Read the lines of text from a file and return them as a list.

    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the file to read.

    Returns:
        list of str: List of lines from the file, or None if the file is not found.
    """

    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            return lines

        print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")
        return None

    while True:
        filename = input("Enter the filename (or '0' to quit): ")

        if filename == '0':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        lines = read_file(filename)

        if lines is not None:
            line_count = len(lines)

            while True:

                    if line_number == 0:
                        break

                    if 1 <= line_number <= line_count:
                        print(f"Line {line_number}: {lines[line_number - 1]}")  
                    else:
                        print(f"Invalid line number. Please enter a number between 1 and {line_count}.")
