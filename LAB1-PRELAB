With the introduction to GitHub, we were able to learn new things. First, in modern software development, Git is an essential distributed version control system that plays a vital role. It allows developers to track 
code changes, collaborate effectively, and revert to prior versions, all of which streamline the development process. This chapter delves into the Git ecosystem, explicitly focusing on hosting platforms like GitHub, 
Bitbucket, and GitLab. These platforms are crucial as they enable developers to store and share code, promoting collaboration, issue management, and continuous integration. By utilizing these hosting platforms, developers 
can efficiently manage their code and streamline the development process. Also, the chapter provides readers with a solid understanding of the key terminology and best practices associated with Git and some typical workflows. Overall, this chapter serves as a helpful starting point for anyone who is new to Git or wants to brush up on their knowledge of version control systems. It allows collaborative work on code and ensures that each collaborator can safely edit and manage the code or its entire infrastructure as long as Git is used to make versions.
